## Full Comparison: Deploying the Same App to Both Platforms

To demonstrate the differences between Vercel and Railway, we'll deploy the same ecommerce application built with Express.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL to both platforms.

### Our Demo Application

We've built a simple ecommerce application with the following features:
- Product listing with category filtering
- Product detail views
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- PostgreSQL database integration
- RESTful API endpoints

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Express.js
- Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Package Manager: npm

### Deploying to Railway

Railway excels at full-stack deployments with integrated database services.

**Step 1: Sign Up and Create Project**
1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" and select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your repository and Railway will automatically detect the Node.js application

**Step 2: Add PostgreSQL Database**
1. In your project dashboard, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" and choose "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway automatically provisions a PostgreSQL instance and provides a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**
Railway automatically detects your `DATABASE_URL` from the PostgreSQL service. You can add additional environment variables in the project settings:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PLATFORM=railway`

**Step 4: Deploy**
Railway automatically builds and deploys your application. The deployment process:
- Detects your Node.js application
- Runs `npm install` to install dependencies
- Builds Tailwind CSS
- Starts your Express server
- Provides a public URL for your application

**Railway Deployment Advantages:**
- Zero-configuration deployment
- Integrated database hosting
- Automatic environment variable management
- Built-in monitoring and logs
- Easy rollbacks and version management

### Deploying to Vercel

Vercel requires more configuration for full-stack applications but excels at frontend optimization.

**Step 1: Sign Up and Create Project**
1. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" and import your repository
3. Vercel will detect your Node.js application

**Step 2: Configure for Full-Stack Deployment**
Since Vercel is optimized for frontend applications, deploying a full-stack app requires specific configuration:

1. **Create `vercel.json` configuration:**
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/server.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/public/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Set up External Database:**
Since Vercel doesn't provide database hosting, you'll need to use an external service:
- Use Railway's PostgreSQL service (ironically)
- Use Vercel's marketplace integration with Railway
- Use other database providers like Supabase, PlanetScale, or Neon

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**
In Vercel's dashboard, add your environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` (from your external database provider)
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PLATFORM=vercel`

**Step 4: Deploy**
Vercel will:
- Build your application using the `@vercel/node` runtime
- Deploy your Express server as serverless functions
- Serve static files from the `public` directory
- Provide a public URL with automatic HTTPS

**Vercel Deployment Challenges:**
- Requires external database setup
- Serverless functions have execution time limits (up to 800 seconds)
- Memory limits (up to 4GB per function)
- Cold starts can affect performance
- More complex configuration for full-stack apps

### Deployment Comparison Results
