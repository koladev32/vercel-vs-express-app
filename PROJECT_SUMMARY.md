## Target Audience
- Web developers choosing deployment platforms
- Startups evaluating hosting options
- Teams migrating between platforms
- Developers building full-stack applications

## Competitive Advantage
This guide addresses the bias in Railway's official comparison by providing:
- Unbiased analysis of both platforms
- Real-world deployment examples
- Comprehensive feature comparison
- Practical cost analysis
- Clear recommendations based on use cases

## Next Steps
1. Create PR for simpletechguides.com/comparisons
2. Deploy demo app to both platforms
3. Gather performance metrics
4. Update guide with real deployment results
5. Publish and promote the guide
